**Welcome to GitHub On-boarding for CoderDojo**

---

GitHub is a web-based platform that allows developers to host, share, and
collaborate on code repositories. As a developer, having a presence on
GitHub can greatly benefit your career by allowing you to showcase your
projects, connect with other developers, and collaborate on open-source
projects.

**Step 1: Creating a GitHub Account**

To get started with GitHub, follow these steps:

1. Go to [GitHub.com](https://github.com) and click on "Sign up" in the
   top-right corner.
2. Fill out the registration form with your email address, username,
   password, and other basic information.
3. Verify your email address by clicking on the link sent to you by GitHub.
4. Set up your profile by adding a profile picture, bio, and other relevant information.

**Step 2: Familiarizing yourself with GitHub Basics**

Now that you have an account set up, let's take a look at some of the basic features:

1. **Repositories**: A repository is a collection of files and folders related to your project.
2. **Commits**: Commits are changes made to your codebase, which can be reviewed by others.
3. **Branches**: Branches are separate lines of development that can be merged into the main codebase.
4. **Pull Requests**: Pull requests allow you to share your work with others and get feedback.

**Step 3: Cloning a Repository**

To start working on a repository, you'll need to clone it locally:

1. Go to the repository you're interested in cloning (e.g., [AI-Development](https://github.com/SentinelMurphy/AI-Development)).
2. Click on the "Code" tab and select "Clone or download".
3. Copy the clone URL.
4. Open your terminal or command prompt and run `git clone <clone_url>`.

**Step 4: Creating a New Branch**

To start making changes to the repository, create a new branch:

1. Run `git branch` to list all existing branches.
2. Run `git checkout -b <branch_name>` to create a new branch (e.g., "new-feature").
3. Verify that you're now on the new branch by running `git branch`.

**Step 5: Making Changes and Committing**

Now it's time to make some changes:

1. Edit files as needed.
2. Run `git add` followed by `git commit -m "<commit_message>"` to commit your changes.

Example:
```bash
git add .
git commit -m "Initial commit for new feature"
```
**Step 6: Creating a Pull Request**

To share your work with others, create a pull request:

1. Run `git push origin <branch_name>` to push your changes to GitHub.
2. Go back to the repository and click on "New pull request" under the "Pull requests" tab.
3. Select the branch you want to merge into (e.g., master).
4. Review and submit your pull request.

**Tips and Best Practices**

* Use meaningful commit messages that describe the changes made.
* Follow standard professional guidelines for code formatting and organization.
* Participate in open-source projects by contributing your own code or reviewing others' work.

That's it! With these steps, you've successfully set up a new GitHub account, cloned a repository, made changes, committed them, and created a pull request. Keep practicing, and you'll become a pro at using GitHub in no time!
